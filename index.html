	<p>This past Christmas 2021, my 9 year old son got a night vision monocular from my parents as a Christmas gift. Since he has gotten it, we have gone 
		out multiple nights at the local state park hoping to see wildlife or even Bigfoot. Unfortunately we have yet to see Bigfoot, but we have had the pleasure
		to see other animals. We have spotted quite a few deer, a field mouse and tried hiding ourselves to see if it worked. My sons night vison has video record functionality and he was actually able to 
		capture the field mouse on video. You can see the mouse run, go behind a log and then its eyes reappear. In my opinion, night vision is great to have 
		as not only a way to see what it out after dark, but also will help you create great memories along the way.</P>
